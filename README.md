# Number Guessing Game

This is my coding challenge submission for day #12 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

Welcome to the *Number Guessing Game*! This game was designed to test your mental dexterity as well as your ability to think quickly. It's a classic and simple game to play, but can be challenging depending on the difficulty level you choose. All you have to do is guess the right number within a certain number of attempts and you win! 


## Getting Started

You'll first be asked to choose a difficulty level for your game. If you choose 'easy' level, you'll have 10 attempts to guess the number. Select 'hard' level to have just 5 attempts. 

When you've chosen the difficulty level, you'll be given a random number between 1 and 100. The goal is to guess this number within the set number of attempts. Each time you guess, the game will tell you if you're too high or too low. Be sure to guess accurately to maximize your attempts!

When you think you have the right answer, type it in and find out if you're correct! If you guess the correct number, you'll be declared the winner. But be aware - you only have a certain number of attempts to get the right number, so use your best judgement. If you run out of attempts without finding the right answer, you lose!

Good luck and have fun!
