This is my coding challenge submission for day #12 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This application is a number guessing game that takes user inputs for guessing the correct number between 1 and 100. On each guess, feedback is given to the user informing them whether the guess is high or low. The game has two settings; easy with 10 guesses and hard with 5 guesses.

## Usage
